    <p>
        Hello! My name is Shivam Kumar, and I am a student who is interested in
        technology and web development. I enjoy learning how websites are
        designed, how pages are connected, and how a simple idea can be turned
        into something that works on the internet.  
        <br><br>
        I am currently focusing on basic HTML and CSS so that I can build clean
        and simple web pages. Creating this portfolio website has helped me
        understand page structure, navigation menus, and how to style content.  
        <br><br>
        Apart from studies, I like working in teams, thinking creatively, and
        trying out new ideas. This portfolio is a small step in my learning
        journey, and I hope to build more advanced projects in the future as I
        improve my skills.
    </p>
